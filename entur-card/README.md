# Entur Card
This card is made to work with the [Entur public transport](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.entur_public_transport/) component. You will have to configure this component before you can use this card.

>⚠️ Unfortunately there is currently no provided method to define a start and a stop station with entur. But you can add a whitelist of *lines* so that you can force only relevant results. For now this card let's you define a destination, only added for visual reasons. Hopefully in the future we can define from / to, by then the destination option will be removed.

### Installation
*This card requires momentjs dependency to display times in various formats.*

- Copy the `entur-card.js` file to your `config/www`
- Add `entur-card.js` and `moment.js` as dependencies in your `ui-lovelace.yaml`

```yaml
